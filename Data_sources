The data used for this analysis were collected from the Google Earth web and SAMGEO-based Lafmap data sources, which have a 15 cm spatial resolution. This means that each pixel represents a 15×15 cm area on the ground, allowing for very fine detail. Google Earth Web displays high-resolution imagery (up to 15 cm) mainly from aerial sources and Maxar satellites. This imagery was used for overlay-based visual analysis only. WorldView-3 satellite offers 31 cm resolution. However, Google Earth provides better aerial data with more detailed information; therefore, the damaged buildings were identified for the earthquake hazard study. SamGeo is a geospatial tool using AI (Segment Anything Model) and is not specifically a data provider. However, it can be used as a source to collect very high-resolution imagery for the current work on earthquake damage analysis. SamGeo-based Leafmap can offer 15 cm imagery for a basic and visual analysis.
